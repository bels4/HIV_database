This scripts use 5 variables ($1 - $5).

$1 == FLAG: -gb or -lanl
$2 == DIR: directory will be created and all downloaded files will be stored here
$3 == PREFIX: Prefix of all accession numbers
$4 == BEGIN: Begginig number. NOTE: it should be only number without prefix
$5 == END: Ending number. NOTE: it should be only number without prefix

NOTE: This script won't work without all this variables, please be careful.

Good luck,
Andrey Kravets
